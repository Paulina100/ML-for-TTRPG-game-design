These petals are coated with iridescent veins that absorb sunlight during the day and give off an eerie yet beautiful glow at night. The glistening patina attracts pollinating insects.</p>\n<p>On their own, glimmervines don't pose much of a threat to most creatures. Though its root-based sensory organs are formidable in close proximity, a glimmervine can't sense creatures farther than 60 feet away, making escape as easy as getting out of range of their slow movement.

horses from the waist down. They are typically reclusive but haughty, quick to assume that their handsome physiques and long history of cultural traditions make them superior to any two-legged folk they encounter. While stories of bloody clashes between centaurs and humanoid settlers are well known, centaurs are neither intrinsically bloodthirsty nor recklessly aggressive. Rather, they are proud and stubborn and do not take kindly to outsiders who encroach on their ancestral grounds, some of which have been ruled by centaurs for thousands of years. Against despoilers of nature who fail to heed their warnings, centaurs do not hesitate to use their finely honed hunting skills to inflict deadly wounds.</p>\n<p>Centaurs train with weapons as well as their heavy hooves, and the thunder of centaurs charging across the plains is often mistaken for a stampede or even an earthquake. Despite their insular nature, some centaurs form close alliances with elves, fey, gnomes, and isolated human communities. Such allies are often surprised to learn the depths of centaurs' honor, pragmatism, and wilderness lore. Rarely, a centaur leaves its tribe to travel the wider world. Such lone centaur wanderers more easily integrate into humanoid societies, but other centaurs are quick to assume that some dishonor led to their exile and thus give such vagabonds a wide berth.</p>\n<p>Centaurs have incredible variation in their individual size and coloration. Their upper bodies are fairly similar within a tribe and even region, but their lower bodies-like those of horses-can vary widely from parent to child. Most centaurs are at least 7 feet tall and weigh more than 2,000 pounds.</p>\n<p>Centaurs live in groups of dozens of members, usually led by an old, powerful seer or battle-hardened warrior who has carried out many noble deeds and earned a lifetime of respect from their comrades. The revered leader guides the habits of their entire group; a wise seer might encourage the tribe to roam far from civilization to preserve the ways of its ancestors, while an aggressive warrior might foster skirmishes with nearby humanoid settlements and even rival centaur groups.</p>","source":{"value":"Pathfinder #187: The Seventh Arch"}},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":8},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":9},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":9}},"traits":{"languages":{"custom":"","selected":[],"value":["common","elven","sylvan"]},"rarity":"common","senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"size":{"value":"lg"},"value":["beast"]},"schema":{"version":0.827,"lastMigration":null}},"type":"npc","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.gatewalkers-bestiary.EfoaqozIWUdm8unh"}}}

Though this process is invaluable, it's also a vulnerability—one that the immolis has evolved to exploit.</p>\n<p>Immolises are psychic predators found all across Castrovel, especially underground and in cool environs. Mostly blind, they hunt by sensing the body heat of other creatures. When an immolis acquires a target, it focuses its innate psychic energies in an invisible beam aimed at its prey. The sudden influx of energy causes the target's metabolism to accelerate rapidly, spurring the creature's body to produce energy at a dangerous rate. This sudden rush of heat literally cooks the creature internally— innards burst, blood boils, and fat catches fire. The end result isn't just warm food, but a meal roasted to morbid perfection.</p>\n<p>An immolis's basic shape resembles that of a spidery, spindly frog covered in delicate scales. The head has a simian muzzle, the lips of which pull back to reveal a squid-like beak. Above the mouth, the creature has three pairs of nostrils, which fare and chuff as the creature hunts. Though they walk with a hunch, immolises climb with shocking speed.</p>\n<p>Unlike many other pyro-predators, immolises have a deep and paradoxical fear of fire, perhaps because they know how easily any flesh— their own included—can blacken and burn. As a result, they prefer to lair near water. This presents its own problem, however, as their heat sense is easily disrupted by creatures taking steps to hide their heat signatures, such as submerging themselves in water or snow. While intelligent enough to communicate and band together with others of their kind, immolises view all other species as either prey or threats and have as little interest in cultural exchange as in personal possessions.

As long as the double exists, you don't gain the <em>Shadewither Key's</em> item bonus to Stealth checks.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Destruction</strong> The <em>Shadewither Key's</em> magic can be destroyed by exposing the artifact to uncontained teleportation energies. If touched to an unlinked or malfunctioning aiudara, the <em>Shadewither Key</em> causes the gate to connect to a new counterpart. If this happens, the key's magic leaves it, rendering the item useless.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Obnubilate Curse</strong></p>\n<p>Only elves can be afflicted with this magical curse; other creatures are immune. An elf who touches the Shadewither Key must save against the curse. Victims quickly fall @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious}; then, over several days, they slowly blacken and shrivel like rotting fruit until they die. The corpse of an elf killed by the obnubilate curse is dry and charcoal-like; it collapses into ash at the slightest touch.</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw</strong> @Check[type:fortitude|dc:27|traits:curse,enchantment,incapacitation,magical,mental,shadow|overrideTraits:true]</p>\n<p><strong>Onset</strong> 1 minute</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 1</strong> unconscious and [[/r 3d6[mental]]] (1 day)</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 2</strong> unconscious and [[/r 6d6[mental]]] (2 days)</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 3</strong> unconscious and [[/r 6d6[mental]]] (2 days)</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 4</strong> unconscious and [[/r 6d6[mental]]], permanent loss of most recent year of memory (1 day)</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 5</strong> unconscious and [[/r 6d6[mental]]], permanent loss of all memory (1 day)</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 6</strong> death.</p>"},"equipped":{"carryType":"worn","handsHeld":0,"invested":null},"equippedBulk":{"value":""},"hardness":0,"hp":{"brokenThreshold":0,"max":0,"value":0},"level":{"value":22},"negateBulk":{"value":"0"},"preciousMaterial":{"value":null},"preciousMaterialGrade":{"value":null},"price":{"value":{}},"quantity":1,"rules":[],"size":"med","slug":"shadewither-key","source":{"value":"Pathfinder #187: The Seventh Arch"},"stackGroup":null,"traits":{"rarity":"unique","value":["artifact","cursed","illusion","invested","primal","shadow"]},"usage":{"value":"worn"},"weight":{"value":"-"},"schema":{"version":0.827,"lastMigration":null}},"type":"equipment"},{"_id":"gNZND9cktvmWzCUJ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Claw","sort":500000,"system":{"attack":{"value":""},"attackEffects":{"custom":"","value":["shadowfeed"]},"bonus":{"value":14},"damageRolls":{"2EOkIWCkJj7TDpfe":{"damage":"1d6+1","damageType":"slashing"}},"description":{"value":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":[]},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"schema":{"version":0.827,"lastMigration":null}},"type":"melee"},{"_id":"eEJbnRRJjKe1QZrQ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Reaction.webp","name":"Phasic Defenses","sort":600000,"system":{"actionCategory":{"value":"defensive"},"actionType":{"value":"reaction"},"actions":{"value":null},"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Requirements</strong> Kaneepo hasn't Slimstepped since the beginning of their last turn</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> Kaneepo would take damage from an attack</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Kaneepo Slimsteps, taking no damage if their new square would move them out of the range or area of the attack.</p>"},"requirements":{"value":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":[]},"trigger":{"value":""},"schema":{"version":0.827,"lastMigration":null}},"type":"action"},{"_id":"snnkc1WVmU7H0RQm","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Create Breach","sort":700000,"system":{"actionCategory":{"value":"offensive"},"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"description":{"value":"<p>Once per day, Kaneepo can tear open the fabric between planes, creating a portal between the Thinlands and a point anywhere in Sevenarches.

Instead, they must harvest appendages and organs from the living to perpetuate their own lives.

Many graft any number of arms or legs of various sizes on their bodies, while others are conglomerations of exotic beasts, other humanoids, and whatever creatures they've hunted or scavenged. However, all umasi remain vaguely humanoid in shape. An umasi with additional arms can hold or wield more items at once, while additional legs or other limbs might grant increased Speed or new types of Speed.

In this time before time, spirit guides took on the most elemental shapes of animals, and they taught humanoid communities about important aspects of nature.
